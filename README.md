Welcome to xmr.st, my minimalist corner of the internet. This site is a lightweight, static website designed to share my personal journey, insights, and knowledge in technology and self-hosting. Built with simplicity in mind, it focuses on delivering information without unnecessary frills, offering a fast and straightforward user experience.
About

I’m a technology enthusiast from North America, passionate about system and network administration, self-hosting, and digital independence. Born in the '90s, I value peace, respect, and harmony in both life and work.

My website serves as a space where I can freely share who I am and what I know. You’ll find posts and resources on various topics in tech, with the aim of empowering others through accessible, hands-on information.
Website Design

This site is purposefully lightweight and minimal, with a dark theme and a clean layout to focus on content. The code is kept straightforward, optimized for fast load times, and all pages and resources are preloaded or prefetched for smooth navigation.

The website is open-source, and I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you’d like to improve or add content to the site.
